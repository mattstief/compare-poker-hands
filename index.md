This program compares two poker hands and judges which one wins.  
The organization of the code is the important bit here, not the actual functionality.  


<h2>to compile:</h2>

<p>`make` stores the output and exe files in the build/ directory.</p>

<h2>to test and run:</h2>

<p>`bash ./poker_test.sh` runs the program with all .txt files in the tests/ directory.</p>    
<p><em>The output is saved to the file "output.txt".</em></p>  
    
  <h3>Test Files/Input</h3>
  <p>Test files are just text files with two lines, one for each hand of cards.</p>
  <p>Each hand should have 5 cards.</p>  
  
  <h4>Cards consist of a face and a suit</h4> <ul> 
      <li>faces: A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K</li>
      <li>suits: H,S,D,C</li> 
    </ul>
